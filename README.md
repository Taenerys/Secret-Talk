# Secret-Talk
A simple DEMO project I have made with my team at SheCodes Hackathon (July 2018) in Hanoi. We came in third place.

The technology we used for this app is Fuse, also known as a toolkit for creating applications on both iOS and Android devices, using JavaScript to write code and offer native-like performances.
This project is for iOS users only.
